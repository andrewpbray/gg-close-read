## GG Close Read

A test to see how close we can get to creating a scrollytelling html document from a Quarto document. The inspiration for this is the Close Read series from the New York Times, specifically:

[*A Poem (and a Painting) About the Suffering That Hides in Plain Sight*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/06/books/auden-musee-des-beaux-arts.html) by Elisa Gabbert.

The result can be viewed on Quarto pubs:

[*A Grammar of Graphics: A close read of a scatterplot*](https://andrew.quarto.pub/gg-close-read/)
